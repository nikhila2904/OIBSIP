		<p>Bill Gates is an American entrepreneur, software developer, investor, and philanthropist. He co-founded Microsoft Corporation with Paul Allen in 1975, which became the world's largest personal-computer software company. Gates is also known for his philanthropic work, primarily through the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.</p>
		<p>Gates was born on October 28, 1955, in Seattle, Washington. He began programming computers at the age of 13 and went on to attend Harvard University, but dropped out in 1975 to co-found Microsoft with Allen. Microsoft went public in 1986, and Gates became one of the richest people in the world. He stepped down as CEO of Microsoft in 2000 and has since focused on his philanthropic work.</p>
		<p>Gates has received numerous awards and honors for his work, including being named one of Time magazine's "100 Most Important People of the 20th Century" and being awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 2016. He has also been criticized for his business practices and for the influence of Microsoft on the personal computer industry.</p>
		<p>Despite the controversies, Bill Gates remains a significant figure in the technology industry and in philanthropy. His work through the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation has focused on improving global health and reducing poverty, and he has pledged to donate the majority of his wealth to charity.</p>
